# The mandelbrot project

## Introduction 

Here is the scripts and lib for using python to do the mandel calculation, 
which is very flexible with the range of real and image numbers, density
over arrays, repeats, and the threshold. 

The mandelbrot is only check with a threshold, usually the absolute is smaller 
than 2. A proper color contour is made by accumulating through the repeats. 

## Codes

 - libmandelbrot.py

 - mpi_getset.py 

## Future work

Should use the Fortran or C++ to demonstrate this calculation, and also
try to do it with MPI or OpenACC with Fortran or C++.
